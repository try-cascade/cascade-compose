# Open-source containerized application deployment with observability

Cascade is an open-source **containerized application deployment** solution with **observability** built in. 
Users can add their containerized applications and Cascade will generate the Terraform config files to deploy each application alongside a collector container onto AWS.

It's **a containerized application deployment accelerator**: it builds and deploys a cloud infrastructure for containers with a side collector for distributed tracing.

Cascade is a fullstack deployment tool that's:
- **Easy to install**: runs on Docker 
- **Easy to use**: automates deployment process with a few clicks
- **Open source**: provides base Terraform templates to build upon

## Who it's for
Cascade was built for users who wish to:

- Deploy their containerized applications onto AWS ECS Fargate
- Be able to see logs and traces without manual effort

## What Cascade does

- Configures the minimum AWS infrastructure required to deploy a containerized app
- Reduces the need to navigate through the AWS management console
- Sets up logs and traces by default

## Prerequisites

- Instrument with [`cascade-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cascade-agent)
- [Configure AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) 
- Running Docker daemon
- Container image


## How Cascade works

Cascade depends on 3 parts:
1. `cascade-agent`: the instrumentation that generates traces, and sends it to AWS X-Ray
2. `cascade-backend`: the API server that creates a user-specific S3 bucket for container information, and generates Terraform config files for deployment
3. `cascade-gui`: the GUI where users can deploy their containerized application, access the generated Terraform config files, and view logs and traces


## Cascade Compose

You can run Cascade with Docker by following these steps:
1. Run the Docker daemon
2. Clone this `cascade-compose` directory
3. `cd` into `cascade-compose` and execute `docker-compose up`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/try-cascade/cascade-compose.git && cd cascade-compose && docker-compose up
```

Cascade will now be ready to plan and deploy your containerized application. You can access the GUI at port 3000.

**Images** 
- `cascade-backend`: handles Terraform config files and communication between Cascade and AWS
- `cascade-gui`: the GUI that handles user interactions

**Container Communication**

The default Docker network created by `docker-compose` enables containers to communicate between themselves using their container names.

**AWS Credentials**

`docker-compose` defines a volume for AWS credentials for `cascade-backend`. When the backend container is started, it uses the volume to allow Terraform to access your configured AWS Credentials.
- In `docker-compose.yml`, the volume for AWS credentials is defined as `~/.aws`, which is the default path on Linux and macOS. Users with a different path for `.aws` must respecify the host path accordingly.
